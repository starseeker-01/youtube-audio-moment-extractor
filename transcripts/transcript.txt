[0.00s - 7.82s]:  On election night 2016, then-President Barack Obama called Donald Trump at about three
[7.82s - 12.76s]:  o'clock in the morning to congratulate him. Even though Mr. Trump had lost the popular
[12.76s - 20.02s]:  vote and took the electoral college by less than 1 percent in three states. Today, President
[20.02s - 25.38s]:  Trump declines to accept the verdict of the voters, despite losing by greater margins
[25.38s - 31.78s]:  to President-elect Joe Biden. Mr. Obama hasn't spoken of the election standoff until
[31.78s - 38.34s]:  today. We spoke to the 44th President on the release of his new book, A Promised Land,
[38.34s - 43.66s]:  a memoir of his early years and first term.
[43.66s - 49.14s]:  The story will continue in a moment.
[49.14s - 54.32s]:  What is your advice in this moment for President Trump?
[54.32s - 62.92s]:  Well, a president is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the office by
[62.92s - 74.56s]:  design. And when your time is up, then it is your job to put the country first and think
[74.56s - 81.98s]:  beyond your own ego and your own interests and your own disappointments. My advice to
[81.98s - 87.88s]:  President Trump is if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody
[87.88s - 92.08s]:  who put country first, it's time for you to do the same thing.
[92.08s - 95.52s]:  In your view, it is time for him to concede.
[95.52s - 101.88s]:  Absolutely. I mean, I think it was time for him to concede probably the day after the election
[101.88s - 107.72s]:  or at the latest two days after the election. When you look at the numbers objectively,
[107.72s - 115.80s]:  Joe Biden will have one handily. There is no scenario in which any of those states would
[115.80s - 122.08s]:  turn the other way and certainly not enough to reverse the outcome of the election.
[122.08s - 126.92s]:  More than the courtesy of a concession, the Trump White House is declining to free up
[126.92s - 132.60s]:  the usual funds and facilities for the incoming administration. President-elect Biden is
[132.60s - 140.24s]:  not receiving secret national security briefings as Mr. Trump did when he was president-elect.
[140.24s - 145.60s]:  What in your estimation would our adversaries be thinking right now? Russia, China, about
[145.60s - 148.20s]:  the fact that the transition is not moving forward?
[148.20s - 158.28s]:  Well, look, I think our adversaries have seen us weakened, not just as a consul in this
[158.28s - 168.68s]:  election, but over the last several years. We have these cleavages in the body politic that
[168.68s - 175.52s]:  they're convinced they can exploit. There is an old adage that partisan politics should stop
[175.52s - 184.32s]:  at the water's edge, right? That when it comes to our foreign policy, that it is the United
[184.32s - 188.64s]:  States of America, not the divided States of America.
[188.64s - 194.28s]:  We met the former president at a symbol of America's past divisions. The Smithsonian's
[194.28s - 200.52s]:  National Portrait Gallery was a hospital in the Civil War. Clara Barton and Walt Whitman
[200.52s - 207.00s]:  cared for patients in the building where the 16th president consoled his wounded. We
[207.00s - 213.04s]:  joined Mr. Obama's peers in the gallery of the presidents to talk about his book.
[213.04s - 219.68s]:  I'm curious about the title. I think a lot of people feel that we are farther from a promised
[219.68s - 220.68s]:  land.
[220.68s - 228.60s]:  Well, I titled it the promised land because even though we may not get there in our lifetimes,
[228.60s - 235.88s]:  even if we experience hardships and disappointments along the way, that I at least still have faith,
[235.88s - 242.36s]:  we can create a more perfect union, not a perfect union, but a more perfect union.
[242.36s - 248.84s]:  You write in the book, our democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of a crisis.
[248.84s - 250.92s]:  What do you mean?
[250.92s - 262.04s]:  We have gone through a presidency that disregarded a whole host of basic institutional norms,
[262.04s - 270.92s]:  expectations we have for a president that have been observed by Republicans and Democrats
[270.92s - 273.32s]:  previously.
[273.32s - 280.52s]:  And maybe most importantly, and most disconcertingly, what we've seen is what some people call
[280.52s - 288.12s]:  truth decay, something that's been accelerated by outgoing president Trump, the sense that
[288.12s - 295.72s]:  not only do we not have to tell the truth, but the truth doesn't even matter.
[295.72s - 302.24s]:  What are these false claims of widespread election fraud doing to our country right now?
[302.24s - 307.40s]:  The president doesn't like to lose and never admits loss.
[307.96s - 313.48s]:  I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better
[313.48s - 318.20s]:  are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion.
[319.32s - 326.28s]:  It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy
[326.28s - 332.92s]:  generally. And that's a dangerous path. We would never accept that out of our own kids behaving
[332.92s - 340.44s]:  that way if they lost. I mean, if my daughter's in any kind of competition,
[341.96s - 349.24s]:  pouted and then accused the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it,
[349.24s - 358.76s]:  we'd scold them. I think that there has been this sense over the last several years that literally
[358.76s - 369.72s]:  anything goes and is justified in order to get power. And that's not unique to the United States.
[369.72s - 376.12s]:  They're strong men and dictators around the world who think that I can do anything to stay in power.
[377.48s - 386.28s]:  I can kill people. I can throw them in jail. I can run phony elections. I can suppress journalists.
[386.60s - 394.52s]:  But that's not who we're supposed to be. And one of the signals, I think, that
[396.44s - 403.16s]:  Joe Biden needs to send to the world is that, no, those values that we preached and we
[404.44s - 408.20s]:  believed in and subscribed in, we still believe in.
[408.76s - 415.40s]:  President-elect Biden won in this election more votes than anyone in history.
[415.88s - 422.60s]:  And yet, the 2020 vote wasn't a repudiation of Donald Trump. It was more like an affirmation.
[423.08s - 431.08s]:  He received 71 million votes, 8 million more than he did in 2016. What does that tell you
[431.08s - 437.40s]:  about our country today? Well, A, it tells us that we're very divided. And as I said,
[438.44s - 441.64s]:  it's not just the politicians now. The voters are divided.
[441.80s - 451.08s]:  It has now become a contest where issues, facts, policies, per se don't matter.
[453.08s - 457.24s]:  As much as identity and wanting to
[459.40s - 466.52s]:  beat the other guy. That's taken priority. I do think the current and media environment adds to
[466.76s - 471.24s]:  that greatly. This democracy doesn't work if we don't have an informed citizenry.
[471.24s - 478.52s]:  This democracy doesn't work if we don't have responsible elected officials at other levels who
[478.52s - 482.60s]:  are willing to call the president when he's not doing something right. Call him on it.
[483.32s - 489.08s]:  It seems, though, Mr. President that Americans have gone from disagreeing with one another
[489.08s - 493.88s]:  to hating one another, the problem that this man had.
[493.88s - 501.88s]:  You know, and I wonder, he's a good example of somebody who I think understood deeply,
[503.32s - 512.84s]:  the need to be able to see another person's point of view. How do we overcome where we are today?
[513.56s - 522.36s]:  There's no American figure that I admire any more than Abraham Lincoln, but he did end up with
[522.36s - 531.64s]:  a civil war on his hands. I like to avoid that. I do think that a new president can set a new tone.
[532.92s - 537.88s]:  That's not going to solve all the gridlock in Washington. I think we're going to have to work
[539.56s - 549.56s]:  with the media and with the tech companies to find ways to inform the public better about the issues
[549.56s - 560.84s]:  and bolster the standards that in short, we can separate truth from fiction.
[561.96s - 567.88s]:  I think that we have to work at a local level. When you start getting to local level mayors,
[570.44s - 574.68s]:  county commissioners, et cetera, they've actually got to make real decisions. It's not abstractions.
[574.84s - 581.32s]:  We need to fix this road. We need to get this snow plot. We need to make sure our kids
[582.76s - 589.96s]:  have a safe playground to play in. At that level, I don't think people have that kind of
[589.96s - 594.68s]:  visceral hatred. That's where we have to start in terms of rebuilding the social trust we need
[594.68s - 602.12s]:  for democracy to work. Mr. Obama is speaking after four years of virtual silence on Donald Trump.
[602.44s - 608.76s]:  He followed a traditional commandment largely observed since Adam succeeded Washington.
[608.76s - 615.88s]:  Thou shalt not criticize your successor. In a promised land, he wonders if that was a mistake.
[616.68s - 625.16s]:  In your book, you ask, quote, whether I was too tempered in speaking the truth, too cautious in
[625.16s - 632.36s]:  word or deed. Many Americans, Mr. President, believe you were, too cautious, too tempered.
[634.04s - 642.52s]:  And I think that's a legitimate and understandable criticism. At the end of the day,
[643.08s - 653.24s]:  I consistently tried to treat my political opposition in the ways I'd want to be treated,
[653.32s - 662.36s]:  to not overreact. When, for example, somebody yells you lie in the middle of me giving a joint
[662.36s - 673.56s]:  congressional address, it's not true. I understand why there were times where my supporters wanted me
[673.56s - 682.12s]:  to be more pugilistic to pop folks in the head and duke it out a little bit more.
[682.28s - 689.32s]:  Was it a mistake that you didn't? Every president brings a certain temperament to office.
[689.32s - 696.84s]:  I think part of the reason I got elected was because I sent a message that fundamentally,
[696.84s - 702.84s]:  I believe the American people are good and decent and that politics doesn't have to be
[703.40s - 713.96s]:  some cage match in which everybody is going at each other's throats and that we can agree
[713.96s - 720.28s]:  you without being disagreeable. There have been worse presidential transitions than 2020.
[720.28s - 726.92s]:  The Southern States seceded while Lincoln was president-elect. Still, we couldn't help but notice
[726.92s - 733.56s]:  outside the national portrait gallery, businesses are still boarded up against the fear of political
[733.56s - 744.44s]:  violence. What should President Trump do on this next inauguration day? Look, there are a set of
[744.44s - 749.80s]:  traditions that we have followed in the peaceful transfer of power. The outgoing president
[749.80s - 755.48s]:  congratulates the incoming president, instructs the government and the agencies to cooperate
[755.48s - 761.56s]:  with the new government coming in. You invite the president-elect to the Oval Office.
[763.24s - 769.64s]:  And then on inauguration day, the president invites the president-elect to the White House.
[769.64s - 775.72s]:  There's a small reception and then you drive to the inauguration site and the outgoing president
[775.72s - 781.08s]:  sits there as part of the audience as the new president is sworn in and at that point,
[781.08s - 787.00s]:  the outgoing president is a citizen like everybody else and owes the new president the chance to do
[787.00s - 794.60s]:  their best on behalf of the American people. Whether Donald Trump will do the same thing,
[796.28s - 801.00s]:  we'll have to see. So far, that's not been his approach.
[801.64s - 811.72s]:  But, you know, hope springs a term. There's a promised land out there somewhere.
[814.84s - 820.12s]:  Two hours after Mr. Obama said that, President Trump tweeted from the White House,
[820.60s - 826.84s]:  we will win, even though no state is reporting fraud or errors that could change the outcome.
[827.56s - 833.80s]:  We'll be back with Barack Obama on other crises in our country and one in his own home.
[843.56s - 849.56s]:  During Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009, unknown to the public,
[849.56s - 856.28s]:  there was intelligence that a terrorist attack was planned. President Obama had at the podium
[856.28s - 863.08s]:  instructions he would read to the crowd, should there be an evacuation of nearly two million people
[863.08s - 869.72s]:  from the National Mall. This is one of the insights in Mr. Obama's new book, A Promised Land,
[869.72s - 877.88s]:  a memoir of his early years, his historic election, and his first term. We spoke to the 44th president
[877.88s - 884.36s]:  about battles past and present. The story will continue in a moment.
[886.68s - 892.60s]:  Did you watch the video of George Floyd's strangulation? Of course.
[894.04s - 900.36s]:  It was heartbreaking. Very rarely, though, did you see it so viscerally? And over a stretch of time,
[900.36s - 909.16s]:  where the humanity of the victim is so apparent, the pain and the vulnerability of someone
[909.88s - 918.60s]:  so clear, and it was, I think, a moment in which America, for a brief moment,
[920.92s - 928.28s]:  came face to face with a reality that African Americans in this country, I think, had understood
[928.28s - 939.00s]:  for quite some time. And I was heartened and inspired by the galvanizing effect that it
[939.00s - 950.92s]:  had on the country as a whole. The fact that it wasn't just black people. It wasn't just so
[950.92s - 957.24s]:  quote-unquote liberals who were appalled by it, reacted to it, and eventually marched. But it was
[957.24s - 968.60s]:  everybody. And it was a small first step in the kind of reckoning with our past and our present
[969.40s - 975.72s]:  that so often we avoid. But Mr. President, Trayvon Martin,
[976.60s - 987.56s]:  Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, why is this injustice never overcome?
[987.56s - 997.96s]:  Well, for a couple of reasons. One is that we have a criminal justice system in which we ask,
[998.04s - 1009.64s]:  oftentimes very young, oftentimes not very well-trained officers to go into communities and just
[1009.64s - 1019.88s]:  keep a lid on things. And we don't try to get at some of the underlying causes for chronic poverty.
[1020.68s - 1026.92s]:  So if we're going to actually solve this problem, there's some specific things we can do to make sure
[1026.92s - 1034.36s]:  that our contracts with police officers don't completely insulate them when they do something wrong,
[1034.92s - 1042.52s]:  putting money into budgets for training. These police officers more effectively,
[1043.16s - 1050.12s]:  teaching police officers not to escalate, but to de-escalate. But it's important for us not to let
[1050.12s - 1055.96s]:  ourselves off the hook and think this is just a police problem. Because those shootings,
[1056.92s - 1067.00s]:  that devaluation of life is part and parcel with a legacy of discrimination and Jim Crow
[1067.64s - 1074.60s]:  and segregation that we're all responsible for. And if we're going to actually put an end to
[1074.60s - 1079.32s]:  racial bias in the criminal justice system, then we're going to have to work on doing something
[1079.32s - 1089.56s]:  about racial bias in corporate America and bias in where people can buy homes. And that is a larger
[1089.56s - 1095.24s]:  project in which all of the good news is all of us can take some responsibility. We can all do better
[1095.96s - 1099.88s]:  on this front than we've been doing. Scott, how are you? Elbow bump?
[1100.36s - 1106.44s]:  On well, Mr. President. We joined the president this past Wednesday behind masks and then kept our
[1106.44s - 1117.16s]:  distance as the U.S. counted 143,000 known COVID infections that day. A new record. Mr. Obama
[1117.16s - 1123.24s]:  had also faced an outbreak in his first term. A new flu, H1N1.
[1123.24s - 1131.32s]:  Well, I was terrified of it. And very quickly mobilized a team to figure out how are we going to
[1131.32s - 1138.60s]:  take the best possible approach. And from the start, I had some very clear criteria, which was
[1138.60s - 1142.76s]:  number one. We're going to follow the science. And the second thing was let's make sure we're
[1142.76s - 1148.68s]:  providing good information to the American people. But H1N1 was not as contagious nor as lethal as
[1148.68s - 1156.52s]:  COVID. It ultimately killed 12,000 Americans. Other battles in his book include the financial
[1156.60s - 1164.04s]:  crisis, passing the Affordable Care Act, the decision to kill Osama bin Laden, and leaving eight
[1164.04s - 1170.36s]:  years of work in the hands of another. You begin the book by writing about the day that you left
[1170.36s - 1178.36s]:  Washington, quote, to someone diametrically opposed to everything we stood for. That may be the
[1178.36s - 1184.28s]:  one thing that Donald Trump and I agree on, is that he doesn't agree with me on anything. I don't
[1184.28s - 1190.68s]:  see him as the cause for our divisions and the problems with our government. I think he's an
[1190.68s - 1199.08s]:  accelerant, but they proceeded. And sadly, are going to likely outlast him. You write in the book
[1199.88s - 1206.68s]:  that Republicans had a battle plan to quote, refuse to work with me, regardless of the circumstances,
[1206.68s - 1213.32s]:  the issue, or the consequences for the country. Now, the same might be said of Democrats
[1213.32s - 1219.88s]:  in a Republican administration. I wonder if today you think that Democrats and Republicans are
[1219.88s - 1231.56s]:  no longer capable of compromise. First of all, I don't think this is just a plague on both
[1231.56s - 1238.68s]:  their houses here. So the Democrats opposed George Bush on a whole bunch of stuff. But Ted Kennedy
[1238.68s - 1246.52s]:  worked with George Bush to pass a prescription drug plan for seniors. Nancy Pelosi, who
[1246.52s - 1254.44s]:  adamantly opposed the war in Iraq, time and again, voted even when her base was angry about it,
[1254.44s - 1260.20s]:  to make sure that our troops were funded once the decision to send in troops to Iraq, went in.
[1260.76s - 1267.00s]:  Mr. Obama blames gridlock on something old and something new. The Senate's filibuster
[1267.00s - 1272.68s]:  tradition, which allows whatever party is in the minority to block legislation and
[1273.32s - 1279.40s]:  non-traditional media. The media landscape has changed. And as a consequence, voters'
[1280.04s - 1286.68s]:  perceptions have changed, so that I think Democratic and Republican voters have become much more
[1286.68s - 1294.04s]:  partisan. I would often hear this from Republicans during my presidency. Some of these folks had been
[1294.04s - 1298.60s]:  colleagues of mine. I served in the Senate. Some of them were friends of mine. And they would
[1298.60s - 1303.16s]:  confess to me, I said, look, Ms. President, I know you're right. But if I vote with you on this,
[1303.16s - 1309.96s]:  I'm going to get killed. I'll lose my seat. Because what had happened is their voter base had
[1311.24s - 1316.04s]:  soaked in so much information that was demonizing me, demonizing the Affordable Care Act,
[1316.04s - 1322.04s]:  that it becomes very difficult, even for folks who want to cooperate, to cooperate. And that's why
[1322.04s - 1331.72s]:  I am somebody who does not blame the current partisanship solely on Donald Trump or solely on
[1331.72s - 1338.28s]:  social media. You already saw some of these trends taking place early in my presidency, but I do
[1338.28s - 1344.68s]:  think they've kept on getting worse. The former president also writes about his unlikely rise,
[1344.68s - 1353.40s]:  including the obstacles at home. You're surprisingly honest in the book about your wife's
[1353.40s - 1361.24s]:  opposition to you running for president in 2008. You quote her as saying, the answer is no.
[1361.96s - 1368.36s]:  I do not want you running for president. God, Barack, when is it going to be enough?
[1369.48s - 1373.48s]:  Did I get the tone right? It was a little sharper than that, but it was pretty good.
[1373.48s - 1376.84s]:  And then she walks out of the room. Why did that not stop you?
[1377.48s - 1384.28s]:  Look, it's a legitimate question. Keep in mind the context here. We had just two years earlier,
[1384.28s - 1390.76s]:  I had run for the U.S. Senate in an unlikely race. Two years before that, I had run for Congress
[1390.76s - 1397.24s]:  in a race you lost. And a race I lost. A couple years before that, I had run for the state Senate.
[1397.24s - 1402.68s]:  We've got two young kids. Michelle's still working. And I asked myself in the book,
[1402.68s - 1409.08s]:  you know, how much of this is just megalomania? How much of this is vanity? How much of this is me trying
[1409.08s - 1417.64s]:  to prove something to myself? And over time, she made a conclusion that I shouldn't stand in the way
[1418.36s - 1423.00s]:  of this. She did. She should not stand in the way of your ambitions to be president.
[1423.00s - 1434.04s]:  Yeah. And she did so grudgingly. And the fact that I ended up winning didn't necessarily
[1434.04s - 1441.08s]:  alleviate her frustration because the toll it takes on families is real.
[1441.80s - 1450.28s]:  I think it's only after you emerge from an all-consuming job that you realize that everything you
[1450.28s - 1456.52s]:  hold dear is thanks to the one you love. I think I actually realized that even while I was in the job,
[1458.28s - 1473.48s]:  the fact that she put up with it and forgave me was an act of grace that I am grateful for,
[1474.20s - 1478.04s]:  and I'm not sure I deserved it. The goal here is to go.
[1478.04s - 1483.80s]:  Today, at age 59, Mr. Obama is working on his presidential center.
[1483.80s - 1490.44s]:  So this is going to be on the South Side of Chicago in historic Jackson Park. And it's the place where
[1491.08s - 1497.48s]:  Michelle and I met where I first started in public life. His team brought this model to show us.
[1498.20s - 1506.20s]:  Mr. Obama's foundation has raised from private donations a little over half the estimated 500
[1506.20s - 1514.12s]:  million dollar cost. It'll take about four years once they start. It's going to be a place where
[1514.12s - 1520.36s]:  we have the standard model of the office and Michelle's dresses, which will be very popular no doubt.
[1521.32s - 1529.40s]:  But also, a whole host of facilities that allow us to provide classroom training to young people
[1529.40s - 1537.48s]:  who are interested in public service. And to beautify a park that can serve a whole bunch of young
[1537.48s - 1544.52s]:  people who've been underserved in the past. In his last moments in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama left
[1544.52s - 1552.20s]:  a note in the president's desk for his successor. It read in part, we are just temporary occupants
[1552.20s - 1558.84s]:  of this office. It's up to us to leave the instruments of our democracy at least as strong
[1558.84s - 1568.28s]:  as we found them. On that last day, the emotions really focus on the team that you've been working on.
[1569.00s - 1578.04s]:  It's very rare outside of maybe wartime where you get a collection of people working together
[1578.04s - 1586.92s]:  in a sustained way under that kind of pressure and stress. There was also, and I write about this,
[1586.92s - 1595.64s]:  a satisfaction in knowing that I had finished the job. I had run my stretch of the race. I could
[1595.64s - 1601.56s]:  say, unequivocally, despite regrets and disappointments about some things not getting done.
[1603.88s - 1607.72s]:  The country was better off when I left than when I got there.
